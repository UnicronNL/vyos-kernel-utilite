* R-Car Audio DMAC peri peri Device Tree bindings

Required properties:
- compatible:	should be "renesas,rcar-audmapp"
- #dma-cells:	should be <1>, see "dmas" property below

Example:
	audmapp: audio-dma-pp@0xec740000 {
		compatible = "renesas,rcar-audmapp";
		#dma-cells = <1>;

		reg = <0 0xec740000 0 0x200>;
	};


* DMA client

Required properties:
- dmas:		a list of <[DMA multiplexer phandle] [SRS/DRS value]> pairs,
		where SRS/DRS values are fixed handles, specified in the SoC
		manual as the value that would be written into the PDMACHCR.
- dma-names:	a list of DMA channel names, one per "dmas" entry

Example:

	dmas = <&audmapp 0x2d00
		&audmapp 0x3700>;
	dma-names =  "src0_ssiu0",
		     "dvc0_ssiu0";
